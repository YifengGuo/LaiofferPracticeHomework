A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation

e.g:
	public static int add(int a, int b) {
		return a + b;
	}
	
	public static: modifier
	int: return type
	add: name of function
	int a, int b: list of parameters (formal arguments)
	
	Function signature in Java:  NAME OF FUNCTION + THE LIST OF THE PARAMETER "TYPES"
	                                                      order of parameter types matter
	                                                      
      Return type cannot be used to identify different functions, because JVM will do type conversion during compilation
      
      when use if, be careful about the return value. Don't take complier too smart.
      
Main function is the entry point of Java program. All other functions are directly or indirectly invoked by main function

public static void main(String[] args) {
	...
}

why main function's return type is void?
	Because some thread invokes the exit method class System. In other words, the program may exit before or after 
	the main() finishes. SO a return value from main would therefore become meanlingless.
	
	If you want the program to return a status code, call:
		System.exit(int status);
		eg:
		public class Solution {
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				System.out.println("Hi");
				System.exit(1);
				System.out.println("Yo"); // cannot be printed
			}
		}
