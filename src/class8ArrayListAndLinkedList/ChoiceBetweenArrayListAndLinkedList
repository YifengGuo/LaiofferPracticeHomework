When to choose what? ArrayList or LinkedList
	1. If you have a lot of random access operations, use ArrayList (get and set is O(1) )
	
	2. If you always add/remove at the end, use ArrayList O(1)
		2.1  When time complexity is similar for using ArrayList and LinkedList, use ArrayList
		     (ArrayList use memory more efficiently- for each element LinkedList needs to create
		     different ListNode in memory, there is extra cost of storing the "next" and "prev"
		     references, and the allocation is not contiguous) ArrayList has better locality
